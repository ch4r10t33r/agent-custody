# This repository is developed under custody: every tool call an agent makes in a Claude Code session here becomes a
# signed receipt, with its hash committed to our tenant on the hosted log within seconds. The receipts, the key, and
# the log token live outside the repository in ~/.config/agent-custody; a machine without that directory is simply
# not recording, and this hook exits quietly so contributors are not affected. See https://agent-custody.dev/custody.
