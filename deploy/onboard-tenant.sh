agent-custody log: welcome sheet for tenant "$tenant"
================================================================================

Your log            https://$log_host/t/$tenant/
Your log id         $log_id
Your checkpoints    https://$cp_host/$tenant/latest.json
The log's keys      https://$log_host/.well-known/agent-custody-log.json  (current keyid ${keyid:-see the document})

Your token is in $store/$tenant.token on this server. Hand it over once, by a channel you trust; it is stored here
only as a hash and cannot be recovered, only replaced (log-admin token add / token revoke).

--- In your gateway or SDK config ---------------------------------------------

  "log": { "url": "https://$log_host/t/$tenant/", "tokenEnv": "AGENT_CUSTODY_LOG_TOKEN", "hashOnly": true }

hashOnly means this log never receives your receipts, only their hashes. Your receipts stay in your receiptsDir.

--- For whoever verifies your receipts ----------------------------------------

  npx agent-custody verify receipts/<id>.json --issuer-key <your gateway.pub> --principal-key <your principal.pub> \\
      --log-url https://$log_host/t/$tenant/ --log-id $log_id

  npx agent-custody audit --older receipts/<earlier>.json --newer receipts/<later>.json \\
      --log-url https://$log_host/t/$tenant/ --log-id $log_id

--log-url fetches this log's published keys and pins them; --log-id makes sure the tree heads are this log's.
An auditor who keeps any signed tree head can later fetch a newer checkpoint from your checkpoints URL and audit
between the two, which proves nothing before it was rewritten.

--- What this log does not do -------------------------------------------------

It holds no receipt contents, only hashes. It cannot forge a receipt: those are signed by your gateway key.
It is one signer today; a second, independent witness is the next step. Ask for the proof table at
https://agent-custody.dev/receipts/#what-a-receipt-proves-and-what-it-does-not before repeating any claim.
