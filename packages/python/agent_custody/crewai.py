"""CrewAI adapter: every tool call is decided, run, and recorded through the sidecar.

Enforce. A denied call never runs; the agent receives the denial text as the tool's result and the crew continues,
which is how CrewAI expects a tool to report a problem. Each wrapped tool keeps its name, description, and argument
schema, so the crew and the model see the same tool as before; only its run goes through custody.
